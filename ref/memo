Kernel Panic! occurs on Windows (my laptop).
Then, I changed the number of processor from 1 to 2.
It doesn't occur.
Why?

sda:sdb:sdc
lvm sd means hard disk
sda: first hard disk
sdb: second hard disk
...

sda5_crypt: maybe encrypted partition
|-host--vg-root
|-host--vg-var
|-host--vg-swap_1
 -host--vg-srv
